# Smart-Shopping-Complex
IoT-based initiative aimed at making purchasing more intelligent, with a focus on pandemic diseases such as COVID-19.
This is my final-year project called "Smart Shopping Complex." This project, as its name implies, focuses on making retail malls far more intelligent. It focuses mostly on pandemic and susceptible diseases such as COVID-19. We attempted to operate in real time, using COVID-19 safety rules such as mask detection, sanitization, and temperature measurement. Customers will be guided to their precise destination via display or indoor map system. Contactless payment methods on smart trolleys, smart parking systems as well as a QR-access door system to strengthen the system's security. In this case, the QR code serves as a gate pass that clients are meant to receive after making a payment.
